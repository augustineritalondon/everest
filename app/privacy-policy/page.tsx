          Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs)
          are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in
          websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide
          usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of
          the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies.
          We may also use tracking technologies in our license buttons and/or
          icons that you can embed on other sites/services to track the website
          addresses where they are embedded, gauge user interaction with them,
          and determine the number of unique viewers of them. If you receive
          email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs,
          to capture data such as whether you open our message, click on any
          links or banners our email contains, or otherwise interact with what
          we send. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our
